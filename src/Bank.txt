To enhance readability in main() a Bank class and an Application class should be created to store needed values and methods

===============================================================
* The Bank class should have the following fields and methods *
===============================================================
Fields:
  initialInvestmentAmount (private double)
  monthlyDeposit (private double)
  interestRate (private double)
  numberOfYears (private int)

Methods:
  Bank(initialInvestmentAmount, monthlyDeposit, interestRate, numberOfYears) - Constructor
    Instantiate a new Bank object with the provided values

  printDetails()
    Prints the provided year index, year end balance, and interest earned as columns in a row

  calculateBalanceWithoutMonthlyDeposit() (void)
    Calculate the year-end balance and year-end earned interest without monthly deposits
    Call printDetials() for each year to create a table of values
    Calculate and print the the total interest earned during the number of years provided
    Print a total row showing the total interest earned
    Return the ending balance and total interest earned using pointers/references

  calculateBalanceWithMonthlyDeposit() (void)
    Calculate the year-end balance and year-end earned interest with additional monthly deposits
    Call printDetails() for each year
    Return the ending balance and total interest earned using points/references

  report() (void)
    To display the requested reports a function should be created which does the following
      Print a header to provide user context for table showing year, year-end balance, and year-end interest earned
      Call bank.calculateBalanceWithoutMonthlyDeposit() to calculate and print annual year-end balance, annual year-end interest earned, and total interest earned without monthly deposits

      Print a header to provide user context for table showing year, balance, and interest
      Call bank.calculateBalanceWithMonthlyDeposit() to calculate and print annual year-end balance, annual year-end interest earned, and total interest earned with monthly deposits

===========================================================
* The Application class should have the following methods *
===========================================================
Application() - Constructor 
  Instantiate an Application object.

mainMenu() (Bank)
  To display the main menu a function should be created which does the following
    Print the requested "Data Input" header

    Print "Initial Investment Amount:"
    Accept user input
    Store value as a double called initialInvestment
    While initialInvestment is not a positive real number
      Print "Invalid response. Please enter a positive real number"
      Print "Initial Investment Amount: "
      Accept user input for initial investment
      Store value as a double called initialInvestment

    Print "Monthly Deposit:"
    Accept user input
    Store value as a double called monthlyDeposit
    While monthlyDeposit is not a positive real number
      Print "Invalid response. Please enter a positive real number"
      Print "Monthly Deposit: "
      Accept user input
      Store value as a double called monthlyDeposit
    
    Print "Annual Interest:"
    Accept user input
    Store the validated value as a double called interestRate
    While interestRate is not a positive real number
      Print "Invalid response. Please enter a positive real number"
      Print "Annual Interest: "
      Accept user input
      Store value as a double called interestRate
    
    Print "Number of Years:"
    Accept user input
    Store the validated value as an int called numberOfYears
    While numberOfYears is not a positive integer
      Print "Invalid response. Please enter a positive whole number"
      Print "Number of Years:"
      Accept user input
      Store value as an int called numberOfYears

    Print "Press any key to continue . . ."
    Await keypress

    Return a Bank constructed from initialInvestment, monthlyDeposit, interestRate, and numberOfYears

restart() (bool)
  Print "Would you like to return to the main menu?"
  Print "Enter 'Y' to return to main menu or 'N' to exit"
  Accept user input and store as a char called userInput

  While userInput is not 'Y' or 'N' 
    Print "Invalid entry. Enter 'Y' to return to main menu or 'N' to exit"
    Accept user input and store in userInput

  If userInput is 'Y'
    return True 

  If userInput is 'N'
    return false

==========================================
* main() should have the following steps *
==========================================
Call Application() to create a new instance of the application object and name it app
Call app.mainMenu() to display the main menu and begin application functionality and assign the returned Bank to a variable bank
Call bank.reports to print out reports
Call app.restart() to prompt for restart or exit
If True - restart
Return(0) to end the program once application is finished
